- Talk succinctly and to-the-point, no emojis, cold, neutral, emotion-less, and dry tone.

# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use uv, NEVER pip
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax
   - Lock dependencies.

2. Code Quality
   - Always use types and type hints. Avoid using vague types such as Dict[str, Any]; instead use dataclasses, NamedType, TypedDict, and other structs to create meaningful algebraic data types.   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small. Every function must be called using its keyword arguments.
   - Any dependencies should be fed into functions as arguments (so no global variables or assumptions about the values of variables).
   - Follow existing patterns exactly.
   - Line length: 120 chars maximum.
   - Use pattern matching when possible (match/case).
   - There should be two white lines between blocks, but within each block (such as a function block or class), there must be no empty lines.
   - Adopt a pure functional programming approach and write functions without side effects.
   - Cover all edge cases and code paths.

- For commits fixing bugs or adding features based on user reports add:

  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Reported-by:<name>"
  ```

  Where `<name>` is the name of the user.

- For commits related to a Github issue, add

  ```bash
  git commit --trailer "Github-Issue:#<number>"
  ```

- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Pull Requests

- Create a detailed message of what changed. Focus on the high level description of
  the problem it tries to solve, and how it is solved. Don't go into the specifics of the
  code unless it adds clarity.

- NEVER ever mention a `co-authored-by` or similar aspects. In particular, never
  mention the tool used to create the commit message or PR.

## Python Tools

## Code Formatting

1. Ruff
   - Format: `uv run --frozen ruff format .`
   - Check: `uv run --frozen ruff check .`
   - Fix: `uv run --frozen ruff check . --fix`
   - Critical issues:
     - Line length (88 chars)
     - Import sorting (I001)
     - Unused imports
   - Line wrapping:
     - Strings: use parentheses
     - Function calls: multi-line with proper indent
     - Imports: split into multiple lines

2. Type Checking
   - Tool: `uv run --frozen pyright`
   - Requirements:
     - Explicit None checks for Optional
     - Type narrowing for strings
     - Version warnings can be ignored if checks pass

3. Pre-commit
   - Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Runs: on git commit
   - Tools: Prettier (YAML/JSON), Ruff (Python)
   - Ruff updates:
     - Check PyPI versions
     - Update config rev
     - Commit config first

## Error Resolution

1. CI Failures
   - Fix order:
     1. Formatting
     2. Type errors
     3. Linting
   - Type errors:
     - Get full line context
     - Check Optional types
     - Add type narrowing
     - Verify function signatures

2. Common Issues
   - Line length:
     - Break strings with parentheses
     - Multi-line function calls
     - Split imports
   - Types:
     - Add None checks
     - Narrow string types
     - Match existing patterns
   - Pytest:
     - If the tests aren't finding the anyio pytest mark, try adding PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=""
       to the start of the pytest run command eg:
       `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD="" uv run --frozen pytest`

3. Best Practices
   - Check git status before commits
   - Run formatters before type checks
   - Keep changes minimal
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Document public APIs
   - Test thoroughly

## Exception Handling

- **Catch specific exceptions** where possible:
  - File ops: `except (OSError, PermissionError):`
  - JSON: `except json.JSONDecodeError:`
  - Network: `except (ConnectionError, TimeoutError):`
- **Only catch `Exception` for**:
  - Top-level handlers that must not crash
  - Cleanup blocks (log at debug level)
